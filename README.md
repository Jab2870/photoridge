# Photo Ridge

This is an open source photo manager for use on personal hosting.

It is written in PHP so should work on most servers.

I have taken a lot of inspiration from the way that WordPress works. I have looked at parts of the WordPress source for inspiration although haven't specifically taken any code unless specified in function block comments.

For example, the WordPress loop is, in my opinion, wonderful for building archive pages for a blog. In this project, I provide a loop-like tool for building gallery overview pages.

Although it is not available yet, I hope that this project will also allow for plugins to be powerful and to be able to replace / enhance functionality for the project.

Themes will work in a similar way to WordPress themes although there are some important differences. These are detailed in the Readme file in the themes folder.
